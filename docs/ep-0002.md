The `bldr` command has the following sub commands:
- `init`
    - Initialize the current directory with a skeleton `.bldr` folder
- `gen` 
    - Run the specified generator.
    - Stored in `generator.toml`
- `gen.up` 
    - Update the current project with the generators listed in `.bldr/generator.toml`
- `gen.rm` (todo)
    - Remove a previously added generator from the project.  Does not apply until `gen.up` is run
- `deps.add`
    - Add a dependency to the current project.  Does not apply until `dep.get` is run
- `deps.get`
    - get deps listed in `dependency.toml`
- `deps.up` (todo)
    - Update deps listed in `dependency.toml`
- `dep.rm` (todo)
    - Remove a previously added template from the project.

# gen <generator_name> <args>

Runs a generator.  It will be recorded in `~/.bldr/generated.toml`

# gen.up

Update the templates and apply them to the current project.

# deps.add

`git` dependencies:
    - Perform a `git submodule add`
    - Record Branch / SHA to `dependency.lock.toml`

`link` dependencies:
    - Create a symbolic link

# deps.get

* `deps.get` Walk each dependency in `dependency.toml`
    * `git` dependencies:
        - Peform a `git fetch` or `git clone` in target dir
        - Reset Branch to SHA in `dependency.lock.toml`
    * `link` dependencies:
        - Remove the link if it is not correct
        - Create the link if it is missing

# deps.up

* `dep.up` Walk each dependency in `dependency.toml`
    * `git` dependencies:
        - peform a `git pull`
        - Check for `dependency.lock.toml`
            - run `dep.up` recursively
        - Save Branch SHA to `dependency.lock.toml`

# Script backend

Individual Scripts live in `~/.bldr/cmd` and can be overriden in `.bldr/cmd`

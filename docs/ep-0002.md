    - Update the current project with the templates listed in `.bldr/template.toml`
- `gen.rm`
    - Remove a previously added template from the project.  Does not apply until `gen.up` is run
- `dep.add`

- `dep.up`
    - Update deps listed in `dependency.toml`
- `dep.rm`
    - Remove a previously added template from the project.  Does not apply until `dep.up` is run
- `dev.add`

# gen.add <template_name> <url> <branch>

Add a new template.  It will be stored in `~/.bldr/template/<template_name>`.  Currently only `git` is supported

`<url>` can be ommited if it is already exists in `~/.bldr/template`
`<branch>` defaults to `master`

# gen.up

Update the templates and apply them to the current project.

Actually a series of sub commands with individual pre/post hooks
    - Each subcommand will honor `.pre` or `.post` hooks in `~/.bldr/cmd` and `.bldr/cmd`

* `gen.up.fetch` Walk each dependency in `dependency.toml`
    - peform a `git fetch`
    * `gen.up.extract_current`
        - `git archive <current_sha> | tar -x -C .bldr/current` to extract it
    - `gen.up.extract_template`
        - `git archive <branch_name> | tar -x -C .bldr/template` to extract it
    - Save SHA to `~/.bldr/current.toml.next`
* `gen.up.diff` 
    - diff `.bldr/current` with `.bldr/template` and apply patch
* `gen.up.complete` 
    Save `~/.bldr/current.toml.next` to `~/.bldr/current.toml`

# Script backend

Individual Scripts live in `~/.bldr/cmd` and can be overriden in `.bldr/cmd`

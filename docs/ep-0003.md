# Templates

A core function of `bldr` is to generate code from templates.  

Goals:
* Each project can have inline-templates
    * These live side-by-side with the files they generate and are useful for one-off codegen
* Each project can have local templates
    * These live in `.bldr/template` and keep templates hidden from the user
    * Is the basis for generators


# Folder structure


`.bldr`
- `history`
    - `next` 
        - New Template to apply to the parent folder
        - Not Version Controlled
    - `current` 
        - Current Template applied to the parent folder
        - Version Controlled
    - `previous`
        - previous `current` folder
        - Not Version Controlled
    - `generated`
        - Folder containing templates generated from generators
        - `current`
            - Currently generated Templates
            - Version Controlled
        - `next`
            - The newly created Templates folder
            - Run by running the generators in order
            - Not version Controlled
            - Becomes `current` at the very end
        - `previous`
            - The previous `current` folder
            - Not version controlled

- `dependency.toml`
    - List of depencencies
    - Section name is the name of the dependency
    ```
    [dep_name1]
    generator = true|false
    path = rel/path/to/extract
    type = git|svn|wget|etc
    version = some_version_string

    [dep_name2]
    path = rel/path/to/extract/another
    ...
    ```
- `dependency.lock.toml`
    - File containing the "lock" info for each dependency
    ```
    [dep_name1]
    sha = 
    branch = 

    [dep_name2]
    md5sum = 

    ...
    ```
- `cmd`
    - Directory to override / extend commands
    - `cmd.pre` script to run prior
    - `cmd` replace/ add command
    - `cmd.post` script to run post
    - Version Controlled
- `template`
    - Root for raw template files that can be directly rendered
- `brick`
    - Folder for containing bricks

- `generator.toml`
    - File containing the list of generator commands that have been run
    - Needed for running `gen.up --regen`
    ```
    gen_cmds = [
        ["some_command", "its", "args"]
    ]
    ```

## Template Rendering

`file.bldr-j2.ext` + `file.bldr-j2.ext.py` -> `file.ext`

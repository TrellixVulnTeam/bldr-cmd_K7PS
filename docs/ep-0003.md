# Templates

A core function of `bldr` is to generate code from templates.  

Goals:
* Each project can have multiple templates layered on top of each other

# Folder structure


`.bldr`
- `next` 
    - New Template to apply to the parent folder
    - Not Version Controlled
- `current` 
    - Current Template applied to the parent folder
    - Version Controlled
- `dependency.toml`
    - List of depencencies
    - Section name is the name of the dependency
    ```
    [dep_name1]
    generator = true|false
    path = rel/path/to/extract
    type = git|svn|wget|etc
    version = some_version_string

    [dep_name2]
    path = rel/path/to/extract/another
    ...
    ```
- `dependency.lock.toml`
    - File containing the "lock" info for each dependency
    ```
    [dep_name1]
    sha = 
    branch = 

    [dep_name2]
    md5sum = 

    ...
    ```
- `device.toml`
    - Track the device(s) that should be updated with `dev.up` is Run
    - Not Version Controlled as each station will be different
    ```
    [device_name]
    addr = 192.168.1.x

    [another_device]
    mdns_name = some_name
    ```
- `cmd`
    - Directory to override / extend commands
    - `cmd.pre` script to run prior
    - `cmd` replace/ add command
    - `cmd.post` script to run post
    - Version Controlled
- `local`
    - Root for raw template files that can be directly rendered
- `generator`
    - Folder for containing generators

# Generator Folder structure

Same basic structure as the `.bldr` folder, containing:

- `dependency.toml`
- `dependency.lock.toml`
- `cmd`
- `local`

## Template Rendering

`file.bldr-j2.ext` + `file.bldr-py.ext` -> `file.ext`

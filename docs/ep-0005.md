# Configuration

bldr's template generation is driven by its config files.  These are simply .toml files which get stacked together to form a final dictionary of information.

# Environment

Each template is passed in the following top level dictionaries: 

* config 
    * (module1key) 
    * (module2key) 

* dep
    * config
    * lock

Where (moduleNkey) is configuration for any arbitrary bldr module


# BLDR_ENV

In addition to config/config.toml, bldr has the following pre-defined "Environments"

* dev - config/dev.toml
* prod - config/prod.toml
* test - config/test.toml

These allow the environment to be tweaked as needed.  Simply set the BLDR_ENV environment variable
as needed

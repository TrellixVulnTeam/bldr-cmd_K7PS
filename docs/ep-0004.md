# Dependencies

A core function of `bldr` is to manage dependencies

Goals
* Each project can have multiple dependencies
* The depedencies can be placed anywhere, not just the `.bldr` folder
* Dependencies that live in `.bldr/brick` are special and extend `bldr` 

# Bricks

Depedencies that live in `.bldr/brick` are considered "bricks" and extend the functionality of `bldr`

* Add new commands
* Add templates
* Add nested dependencies

# Brick Folder structure

Same basic structure as the `.bldr` folder, containing:

- `dependency.toml`
- `dependency.lock.toml`
- `cmd`
    - Directory containing additional commands
- `template`
    - Folder containing template files

# Dependencies

A core function of `bldr` is to manage dependencies

Goals
* Each project can have multiple dependencies
* The depedencies can be placed anywhere, not just the `.bldr` folder
* Dependencies that live in `.bldr/brick` are special and extend `bldr` 

# Bricks

Depedencies that live in `.bldr/brick` are considered "bricks" and extend the functionality of `bldr`

* Add new commands
* Add templates
* Add nested dependencies

# Brick Folder structure

Same basic structure as the `.bldr` folder, containing:

- `dependency.toml`
- `dependency.lock.toml`
- `cmd`
    - Directory containing additional commands
- `template`
    - Folder containing template files

# Git Integration

Git dependencies are stored as `git` submodules.  This is to take advantage of all the tooling that
exists for submodules.

The author(s) are well aware of the short comings of `git` submodules.  Thus bldr adds the following
integration points:

* `deps.get` will install `git` hooks to:
    * Keep the `depedency.lock.toml` file up to date
    * Prevent `push` if a submodule has not already been pushed
    * Update dependencies when the branch changes

* Instead of leaving submodules in `detached HEAD` mode, the submodules will be checked out on
    the specified branch.  
      * The branch will be adjusted so that its HEAD points to the locked SHA
      * Any changes in the submodule will be stashed prior to this operation
      * This behavior can be be opted out of by specified `locked = true`

# FAQ

## I switched branches and now my submodule changes are gone!

Run the following command in the submodule directory
```
git stash pop
```

## I Updated my dependencies and my commited changes are gone!

Use `git reflog` in the submodule to see where the branch pointed before

Change the branch back by using `git reset <PREVSHA>`
